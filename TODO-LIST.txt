If there's time (before PI form presentation due date on April, 10th):
200. FRONT: store backend host and port in .env and use them in redux actions
201. BACK: Refactor initial loading of pokemon's types from API to DB (now it is done on db.js with the funcion storeTypesFromAPItoDB(Type) and maybe it should be in index.js after synchronizing the models and before starting the server).
202. BACK: Testing.
203. FRONT: Testing.
